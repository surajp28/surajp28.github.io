                    <p>
                        I am currently a student at Indiana University pursuing Masters in Computer Science. My area of interest is Software Engineering - The journey to which began in 2014. I was enrolled in TSEC, Mumbai University, India majoring in Computer Engineering. Subjects like Analysis of Algorithms, Data Structures and Objected Oriented Programming laid down the foundations of programming for me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Post my Bachelorâ€™s degree I joined ITIVITI as a Software Engineer. For 2.5 years I worked on multiple projects with different teams using latest technologies, thereby getting an exposure to the Software Industry. The experience was highly helpful on the technological front as well as personal growth by having a culture that promotes skills such as leadership, better communication and team-building. 
                    <p>
                   In my free time I like to read and stay-up-to date on social media. I am an outdoor sports person with chess being an exception. I enjoy traveling and wish to explore as much as I can.
